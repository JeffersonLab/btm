                 ask for it since each app must also explicitly exclude xerces (see below).

             Wildfly implicitly adds Xerces XML parser, but that's an old lib that has effectively been merged with
             modern JDKs, and the old lib breaks Apache POI (Export to Excel).
             Could not find an exclude all Wildfly config and deleting it is no-go because internally Xerces is
             used by Wildfly.  Therefore we must exclude in each app that needs POI.  -->
